The trajectory details a complex debugging journey from an initial MVP to a fully functional Auto Vocal Chain feature. The previous AI engineer initially resolved core Audio Unit preset generation issues. My work began with fixing critical FastAPI routing problems (specifically, the  endpoint returning 404s due to incorrect router inclusion order and a  directory permission issue, which was resolved by switching to ).

Subsequently, the focus shifted to the frontend, which was also incorrectly calling the backend. After resolving initial frontend UI and endpoint issues, the user revealed they were running the application locally, causing environment variable caching and local backend 404s despite the external backend working. The decision was made to enhance the Python fallback mechanism for local development and consolidate frontend logic for URL and file uploads into a single unified flow.

The persistent problem then became parameter application within generated presets. Initial attempts to fix this by adding missing plugins (MEqualizer, MCompressor) and using exact parameter names from  files proved insufficient. Diagnostic logging revealed that the Swift CLI for preset generation was not working in the container, forcing a fallback to a Python method that initially just copied seed files. Even after fixing the Python fallback to use , most plugins still failed to apply parameters correctly. The final root cause identified from detailed backend logs is a pervasive mismatch: the Python backend's parameter conversion logic is still using human-readable names where the Swift CLI (or its Python fallback via ) expects numeric indices or specific, exact parameter keys from the  files. While TDR Nova and 1176 Compressor show some success due to their specific parameter handling, other plugins are failing silently, applying zero parameters.

<product_requirements>
The initial product, a Vocal Chain Assistant, generated production-ready Audio Unit (AU) presets for Logic Pro for nine specific plugins, solving inert preset issues. The current, ongoing objective is to build an Auto Vocal Chain pipeline. This pipeline should automate vocal chain creation by allowing users to upload or provide an audio URL, performing advanced audio analysis (e.g., BPM, key, LUFS, spectral tilt, vocal F0, sibilance). Based on this analysis, it should recommend a chain archetype and concrete, professional-grade parameters for all nine plugins (Graillon 3, TDR Nova, 1176, LA-LA, Fresh Air, MConvolutionEZ, MEqualizer, MCompressor) using detailed mapping rules. Finally, it must generate  files and a , packaging these into a downloadable ZIP file. Key non-functional requirements include backend API routes prefixed with , a performance target of less than 10 seconds for 3-minute tracks, genre presets, inter-stage gain matching, hard caps on parameters, and rationales for recommendations.

<pending_tasks>
-   Fix parameter name mapping in the backend's  function (in 's fallback system and potentially 's professional system) to use numeric indices from  files for all plugins that expect them, instead of human-readable names, for MEqualizer, Fresh Air, Graillon 3, MCompressor, MConvolutionEZ, and LA-LA's .
-   Verify each plugin individually after mapping fixes to ensure parameters are applied correctly.

<current_work>
Currently, the Auto Vocal Chain feature has a unified frontend allowing both URL and file audio input. The backend successfully processes audio, performs advanced analysis, and generates professional parameter recommendations. The system is configured to use the professional parameter generation path. However, when the frontend attempts to call the  endpoint on the user's local backend, it consistently receives a 404 error, causing a fallback to a legacy preset generation path within .

Despite the fallback, detailed backend logs reveal that this legacy path now attempts to use PROFESSIONAL parameter generation with the recently introduced 4-plugin chain (TDR Nova and 1176 Compressor instances) that was intended to simplify the working set. However, the  function subsequently processes 7 or 8 plugins (MEqualizer, TDR Nova, MCompressor, MEqualizer, Fresh Air, LA-LA, MConvolutionEZ, Graillon 3), indicating a discrepancy between the intended optimized chain and what is actually being processed in the fallback.

Crucially, the backend logs show that while 1176 Compressor and TDR Nova successfully apply a number of parameters, MEqualizer, MCompressor, Fresh Air, Graillon 3, LA-LA, and MConvolutionEZ are largely failing to apply parameters, with the Swift CLI logging Warning: Parameter not found for the human-readable parameter names being passed. This confirms that the core issue is an ongoing mismatch between the parameter keys expected by the underlying AU preset generator (numeric IDs or specific strings from ) and the parameter names generated by the Python backend's conversion logic. The generated  files for these problematic plugins are either small (e.g., 894 bytes for MCompressor, 1157 bytes for MEqualizer) or, in the case of Fresh Air, only partially successful (1/3 parameters applied).
