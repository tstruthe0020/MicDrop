The trajectory details an extensive debugging and development process for a Vocal Chain Assistant application. The core objective pivoted from Python-based Logic Pro preset generation to a native Swift CLI approach, aiming for more robust Audio Unit (AU) parameter control. Initial efforts focused on fixing Swift compilation errors, followed by iterative testing of the Swift CLI's ability to generate functional  files for specific plugins. A significant milestone was the successful generation and application of TDR Nova and MEqualizer presets within Logic Pro. The subsequent phase involved integrating this Swift CLI into the FastAPI backend, updating the React frontend for direct installation to Logic Pro, and resolving numerous dependency, environment variable, and path-related issues for a local macOS setup. The process uncovered and addressed critical discrepancies in plugin parameter mapping and file path configurations between the server-side logic and the local Mac environment. The current challenge lies in the Swift CLI's Audio Unit instantiation when invoked by the Python backend.

<product_requirements>
The Vocal Chain Assistant aims to analyze audio, recommend vocal processing chains (plugins + parameters), and export Logic Pro presets. Initially, it focused on stock Logic Pro plugins, but it shifted to 9 specific free third-party Audio Unit (AU) plugins (1176 Compressor, MAutoPitch, MCompressor, MEqualizer, Graillon 3, TDR Nova, LA-LA, Fresh Air, MConvolutionEZ). The system requires managing XML-based  files for these plugins. The frontend (React) must display recommendations. The latest requirement is to replace the Python CLI with a Swift CLI tool () that uses native macOS Audio Unit APIs to directly instantiate AUs, set parameters, export their state into valid  files, and automatically install them into Logic Pro's preset directories, eliminating the need for manual downloads.

<code_architecture>


-   : The main FastAPI application. Updated to include  endpoint, handle  environment variable, implement CORS middleware, and process vocal chain recommendations and direct Logic Pro installations. The  endpoint now expects , , and .
-   : Rewritten to focus exclusively on the 9 specified free third-party plugins for recommendations.
-   : Critical Python wrapper for the Swift CLI. Modified extensively to use the correct local path for the Swift binary (), correctly find seed files (), and manage plugin name-to-seed filename mapping to resolve No seed file found errors. Contains a hardcoded list of plugin names to their  file names (e.g., TDR Nova to TDRNova.aupreset).
-   : Original logic for .cst and ZIP bundling was adapted to delegate .aupreset generation to the CLI system for direct installation.
-   : The main React UI component. Modified to call the new backend  endpoint for direct Logic Pro installation, removing previous download functionality.
-   : Defines the Swift package, including  dependency.
-   : The core Swift CLI logic. Heavily modified and debugged for:
    -   Correct  type inference.
    -   Simplified JSON decoding to  for parameters.
    -   Correct fourCC string conversion for manufacturer display.
    -   Removal of the  check for parameter value clamping, to avoid compilation errors on newer Swift versions.
    -   Includes  class to encapsulate generation logic.
-   : New JSON files created/updated for each of the 9 plugins (e.g., , ). These store mappings from human-readable parameter names to the plugin's actual numeric Audio Unit parameter IDs and their normalized value ranges.
-   : The 9 original seed files, now expected at  on the user's Mac.
-   New utility scripts for local Mac development: , , , , ,  for easier setup and debugging.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Resolve the current Audio Unit instantiation failure within the Swift CLI when it's invoked by the Python backend.
-   Ensure all 9 plugins can successfully generate and install functional  files into their correct Logic Pro directories.
-   Address potential  environment variable usage in the backend to make paths configurable.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently debugging an issue where the backend, despite correctly identifying seed files and having the Swift CLI executable, is failing to install presets. The API response indicates No presets were installed with empty error messages for most plugins, but some output (like  logs for Fresh Air) suggests the Swift CLI is being invoked. This points to a failure during the Audio Unit instantiation or parameter setting *within* the Swift CLI, which is being called by the Python backend. The immediate prior action was receiving output indicating that seed files were found, but the API still reported No presets were installed with several empty error messages for each plugin, after fixing a conflict in seed file mapping within  to correctly match actual filenames (e.g.,  instead of ).

<optional_next_step>
Run the  script to gather detailed logs on Audio Unit availability and instantiation errors from the Swift CLI itself.
