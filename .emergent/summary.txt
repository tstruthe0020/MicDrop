The provided trajectory details a complex journey of debugging and enhancing a Vocal Chain Assistant application. Initially, the core challenge involved transitioning from a Python-based preset generator to a native Swift CLI for robust Audio Unit (AU) parameter control and direct Logic Pro integration. Key phases included resolving Swift compilation issues, ensuring successful  file generation for specific plugins like TDR Nova and MEqualizer, and integrating the Swift CLI with a FastAPI backend and React frontend.

Significant efforts were dedicated to addressing discrepancies in plugin parameter mapping, managing file paths across different environments (container vs. macOS), and resolving permission issues for Logic Pro directory writes. The system evolved through stages of direct Logic Pro installation attempts, debugging persistent No presets installed errors, implementing a parameter conversion function for Swift CLI compatibility, and finally, reverting to a robust download system due to macOS environmental complexities. The current state sees the AI engineer in the midst of implementing a highly detailed user request for improved preset packaging, leveraging macOS-native  for ZIP creation with a specific Logic Pro-mirroring folder structure, and precise parameter application. This involves significant changes to the Swift CLI and subsequent backend updates to utilize these new capabilities.

The Vocal Chain Assistant is designed to analyze audio, recommend vocal processing chains (plugins + parameters), and export Logic Pro presets. The application now targets 9 specific free third-party Audio Unit (AU) plugins (1176 Compressor, MAutoPitch, MCompressor, MEqualizer, Graillon 3, TDR Nova, LA-LA, Fresh Air, MConvolutionEZ). The system requires managing XML-based  files. The React frontend displays recommendations.

The primary objective shifted to replacing a Python CLI with a Swift CLI tool () that uses native macOS Audio Unit APIs to instantiate AUs, set parameters, and export their state into valid  files. Initial requirements focused on automatically installing these presets into Logic Pro directories. However, due to persistent macOS permission and pathing issues, this evolved to a requirement for generating and bundling these presets into a single  file that precisely mirrors Logic Pro's expected folder layout (), allowing users to simply unzip it into their  folder. Parameters must correctly apply upon loading in Logic Pro. The Swift CLI needs to support packaging options like  and , utilizing  for macOS-native ZIP creation.

-   : Main FastAPI app.
    -   **Changes**: Extended to include , , , . Updated  (later changed to ) to handle new CLI parameters, environment-aware pathing, and robust error handling for multiple plugin generations and ZIP creation. Added  endpoint for audio processing and chain generation.
-   : Python wrapper for the Swift CLI.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified for environment detection (macOS/container), configurable Swift CLI binary and seed paths, and a  utility for mapping Python types (bool, string) to Swift . Implemented logic to generate presets directly into specified  (removing nested folders), manage per-plugin path configurations, and handle -based ZIP packaging logic (currently in Swift, Python to integrate).
-   : Main React UI.
    -   **Changes**: Added System Config tab with UI for displaying system info and configuring global/per-plugin paths. Modified  to call , skipped file upload, and adjusted to backend response structure ().
-   : Core Swift CLI logic.
    -   **Changes**: Modified for , JSON decoding of parameters, and handling specific plugin parameter types.
    -   **Recent Changes**: Updated to support new  CLI options: , , , , and  command for macOS-native ZIP creation with the specified  structure.
-   : JSON files for plugin parameter mappings.
    -   **Importance**: Translate human-readable parameter names to plugin-specific numeric Audio Unit parameter IDs and normalize values. Essential for the Swift CLI to correctly set parameters.

<pending_tasks>
-   Integrate the parameter conversion logic (from  function) directly into the backend  to ensure all presets generated via the API use correct parameter types.
-   Rebuild the Swift CLI on the user's Mac to incorporate the new  options,  zipping, and Logic Pro-mirroring folder structure.
-   Update the Python backend's  to utilize the new Swift CLI's  and  options.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer received a detailed specification from the user regarding the Swift CLI's preset generation and packaging. The user reported that while presets were loading in Logic Pro, the parameters were not changing. The new specification requests:
1.  Reliable preset flow (instantiate AU → set by param IDs → capture ClassInfo/fullState → write ).
2.  Bundling all generated presets into a single  that mirrors Logic Pro’s folder layout ().
3.  New CLI options for  in the  Swift tool: , , , and .
4.  Using macOS-native  command for ZIP creation.

The AI engineer has already **modified ** to implement the requested  zipping, staging of presets into a temporary folder structure (e.g., ), and new  CLI arguments. The code sketch provided by the user was largely incorporated.

The immediate step the AI engineer requested from the user was to **manually update this  file on their Mac**, then **rebuild the Swift CLI** to integrate these changes.
