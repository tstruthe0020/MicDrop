The trajectory chronicles an iterative development of a Vocal Chain Assistant for Logic Pro. Initially, the AI engineer faced challenges with Logic Pro's proprietary binary preset formats, leading to a strategic pivot to free third-party Audio Unit (AU) plugins. A Python CLI system for  generation was implemented, followed by extensive debugging to correctly apply parameters for diverse plugin formats (XML vs. binary) and ensuring the frontend integration worked. A critical decision was made to shift from the Python CLI's reverse-engineering approach to a new Swift CLI solution that leverages native macOS Audio Unit APIs for robust preset generation. The current phase involves assisting the user in compiling this Swift CLI on their Mac, addressing recurring compilation errors. The core challenge throughout has been the accurate and reliable generation of functional  files that correctly modify plugin parameters within Logic Pro.

The goal is to build a Vocal Chain Assistant that analyzes audio (beat, vocal), recommends a vocal chain (plugins + parameters), and exports Logic Pro presets.
Initially, the focus was on stock Logic Pro plugins, but this pivoted to a specific set of 9 free third-party Audio Unit (AU) plugins: 1176 Compressor, MAutoPitch, MCompressor, MEqualizer, Graillon 3, TDR Nova, LA-LA, Fresh Air, MConvolutionEZ.
The system needs a Python CLI tool () and library () to manage XML-based  files for these 9 plugins, including loading, saving, extracting identifiers/parameter maps, and applying values. The frontend (React) must display recommendations and offer individual download buttons for each plugin preset.
The latest and current requirement is to replace the Python CLI with a Swift CLI tool (). This Swift tool should generate valid  files by directly instantiating Audio Units, setting parameters, and exporting the plugin's own state via macOS Audio Unit APIs, avoiding binary reverse-engineering. It must accept seed  files, a values JSON, an optional map JSON, and output correctly loading presets for all 9 specified plugins.

<code_architecture>

- : The main FastAPI application. It was updated to handle a new  endpoint and to integrate a fallback mechanism to either use the new Swift CLI (if available) or the existing Python CLI for preset generation.
- : This file was completely rewritten to *only* recommend the 9 specified free third-party plugins, addressing an issue where older, unwanted plugins were being suggested.
- : This file handles the conversion of structured plugin parameters into the XML  format. Its logic was refined to correctly manage AU identifiers and parameter normalization.
- : This module, responsible for handling  and ZIP bundling, was modified to delegate  generation to the new CLI system (or its Python fallback). It was key in fixing parameter application and download issues for individual plugins and the main chain.
- : The primary React component for the user interface. It was modified to display detailed parameter breakdowns for recommended plugins and to include individual download buttons for each plugin preset.
- : This core Python library provides functions for  file operations, including loading, saving, extracting plugin metadata, parsing parameter structures, and applying values. It was enhanced to correctly handle both XML and binary parameter data, forming the basis of the Python fallback system.
- : This file defines the Swift package for the new Audio Unit preset generator CLI, including its name, platforms, products, and dependencies (like ).
- : This is the core Swift code for the  CLI. It's designed to instantiate Audio Units, set their parameters based on input, and export their native state into valid  files, bypassing the need for binary reverse-engineering. It's currently being debugged for compilation issues on the user's Mac.

<pending_tasks>
-   Successfully compile the Swift CLI tool () on the user's macOS machine.
-   Verify that the compiled Swift CLI tool can generate valid  files that correctly apply parameters for all 9 specified plugins in Logic Pro.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently assisting the user with the setup and compilation of the new Swift CLI tool () on their macOS machine. The user has successfully installed Swift and set up the project structure. However, the  command is failing due to Swift compilation errors, specifically generic parameter T could not be inferred and nil requires a contextual type in . The AI's immediate action is to provide a corrected version of  to resolve these specific compilation issues, aiming to get the Swift CLI successfully built and executable on the user's local environment.
