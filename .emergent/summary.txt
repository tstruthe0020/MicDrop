The previous AI engineer successfully debugged the core Audio Unit preset generation system, fixing manufacturer directory mismatches and ensuring all nine plugins generated presets. The current work focused on building the Auto Vocal Chain pipeline, involving new backend services for audio analysis and parameter recommendation, and subsequent frontend integration.

Key challenges during this phase included resolving  import issues, persistent FastAPI routing errors for  and  (despite multiple fixes), a  formatting error in audio analysis, and a React rendering issue on the frontend. While comprehensive audio analysis and advanced parameter *calculation* logic (Phase 1 & 2) have been implemented, the system is failing to correctly *apply* these calculated parameters to most plugins during preset generation. Specifically, the  endpoint returns a 404, and the log shows a fallback to legacy/default parameters for most plugins, with only TDR Nova and 1176 Compressor parameters seemingly applying. Fresh Air also fails to generate. The current task is to ensure the calculated professional parameters are correctly mapped and utilized by the preset generator.

<product_requirements>
The initial product goal was a Vocal Chain Assistant generating production-ready Audio Unit (AU) presets for Logic Pro for nine specific plugins, addressing inert preset issues and providing a downloadable ZIP. This was achieved.

The current, ongoing requirement is to implement an Auto Vocal Chain pipeline. This automates vocal chain creation by:
1. Downloading or uploading audio.
2. Performing advanced audio analysis (BPM, key, LUFS, spectral tilt, low-end dominance, brightness, transient density, vocal F0, sibilance, mud, nasal, plosives, dynamic spread).
3. Recommending a chain archetype and concrete, professional-grade parameters for all 9 plugins based on detailed mapping rules (Graillon 3, TDR Nova, 1176, LA-LA, Fresh Air, MConvolutionEZ).
4. Generating  files and a .
5. Returning a ZIP file with presets and report.
This pipeline exposes  and  endpoints, with a performance target of < 10s for 3-min tracks. The system also requires genre presets, inter-stage gain matching, hard caps on parameters, and rationales for recommendations.

    - **Changes**: Enhanced with detailed spectral, dynamic, and vocal analysis parameters.
- ****: Logic for recommending chain archetypes and parameters.
    - **Changes**: Implemented comprehensive professional parameter calculation logic (Phase 1 & 2 of user's request).
- ****: Adapts recommended targets to existing preset generator.
    - **Changes**: Added a new  method and updated to use exact plugin parameter names from  files for Graillon 3, 1176, LA-LA, Fresh Air, MConvolutionEZ, and TDR Nova.
- ****: Main React component.
    - **Changes**: Added new ðŸŽµ Auto Chain tab, UI for file upload, and display of enhanced analysis results. Fixed React rendering error for key display.
- ****: JSON files for parameter mappings.
    - **Importance**: Provides the exact parameter names for each plugin, crucial for correct parameter application. These were consulted to fix parameter mapping.

<pending_tasks>
- Debug and resolve why the professional parameter mapping is not being applied for all plugins, leading to default/legacy parameters for some (MEqualizer, Graillon 3, LA-LA, MConvolutionEZ, Fresh Air failure).
- Ensure the  endpoint is correctly registered and accessible (it returned 404 in the latest logs).

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully integrated an Auto Vocal Chain tab into the frontend (), allowing users to upload audio files. The backend now performs detailed audio analysis (BPM, key, LUFS, spectral tilt, vocal F0, sibilance, etc.) via the  endpoint and displays these results on the frontend. The system also calculates professional parameters for multiple plugins (Graillon 3, TDR Nova, 1176, LA-LA, Fresh Air, MConvolutionEZ) based on the analysis. Manufacturer directory issues for MCompressor and Fresh Air were resolved, allowing their presets to be found.

However, despite these parameter calculations and mapping updates in , only TDR Nova and 1176 Compressor currently show correct parameter application. The core issue, identified in the latest log, is that the  key is missing from the targets being passed to the , causing the system to fall back to legacy/default processing for other plugins. The  endpoint also consistently returns a 404, preventing the full auto-chain generation pipeline from being correctly invoked. Fresh Air plugin generation is failing with return code -6.
