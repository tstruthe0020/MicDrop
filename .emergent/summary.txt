The previous AI engineerâ€™s work began by rigorously debugging an existing Audio Unit preset generation system. Initial challenges involved resolving parameter conversion and pathing mismatches within the Python backend, particularly for 1176 Compressor, Graillon 3, and LA-LA, which were incorrectly reported as failing by the Swift CLI. A crucial discovery revealed these plugins were successfully generating presets, but the backend's directory mapping for manufacturers (e.g.,  vs. ) was incorrect. This was fixed by updating the  function. Post-fix, comprehensive testing confirmed all nine plugins now generate presets flawlessly, both individually and within vocal chains, with accurate parameter handling.

The subsequent task was to develop an Auto Vocal Chain pipeline for intelligent audio analysis and parameter recommendation. This involved creating an entirely new backend architecture with dedicated services for audio download, analysis, recommendation, Graillon key mapping, preset bridging, reporting, and zipping. Initial integration and development faced several technical hurdles, including Pydantic  and schema generation issues, an uninstalled FFmpeg dependency, and persistent  errors within the  during parameter conversion. FFmpeg was installed and its pan filter syntax fixed, and Pydantic type hints were adjusted. While the  endpoint now successfully processes audio and returns analysis, the  endpoint is currently failing with No presets were generated after resolving previous  errors. The work has transitioned to integrating the new functionality into the frontend as requested by the user.

<product_requirements>
The initial product requirement was to create a Vocal Chain Assistant capable of generating production-ready Audio Unit (AU) presets for Logic Pro. This system needed to support nine specific plugins (TDR Nova, MEqualizer, MAutoPitch, MCompressor, MConvolutionEZ, 1176 Compressor, Graillon 3, Fresh Air, LA-LA) using a Hybrid XML Injection for JUCE-based plugins (TDR Nova) and a standard AU API for others. The goal was to overcome inert preset issues and provide a fully functional end-to-end workflow from frontend vibe selection to downloadable, working ZIP files for Logic Pro. This objective has been successfully achieved, with all 9 plugins now confirmed to generate valid presets.

The current, ongoing requirement is to add an Auto Vocal Chain pipeline to the backend. This new feature will automate the vocal chain creation process by:
1. Downloading input audio (URL or upload) to .
2. Analyzing the mix and vocal track (if present) using Python libraries like librosa, numpy, scipy, pyloudnorm, soundfile, ffmpeg-python, yt-dlp.
3. Recommending a chain archetype and concrete parameters for all 9 plugins.
4. Generating all 9  files using the existing preset generators.
5. Reporting decisions and metrics in a .
6. Returning a ZIP file containing the  files and .
This pipeline must expose  and  endpoints. Performance target: analysis < ~10s for a 3-min track.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was actively implementing the Auto Vocal Chain pipeline in the backend. A new, modular directory structure under  has been created, housing services for audio download, analysis, recommendation, Graillon key mapping, preset bridging, reporting, and zipping. Required dependencies, including , have been installed.

The  endpoint is now successfully functional. It processes an input audio file and returns a detailed JSON analysis, including BPM, key, loudness (LUFS), dynamics, spectral characteristics, and vocal diagnostics. This endpoint was debugged and fixed for several issues: an initial  installation error, a subsequent  filter syntax problem (pan filter), and Pydantic / type-hinting issues in  and .

However, the main  endpoint is currently not fully functional. It is past the  errors encountered during parameter conversion within  and now consistently fails with an error indicating No presets were generated. This suggests an issue further down the pipeline, potentially in how  invokes the  or the underlying Swift CLI within the new auto-chain context, or a pathing issue specific to the container environment for the preset generation step.

The user has explicitly requested to proceed with frontend integration for the Auto Vocal Chain functionality, providing a sample audio URL (). The AI engineer has just begun examining the frontend structure ( and ) to prepare for this integration.
