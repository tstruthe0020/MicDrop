The previous AI engineer's work primarily focused on transitioning the Vocal Chain Assistant from a Python-based preset generator to a native Swift CLI for robust Audio Unit (AU) parameter control and Logic Pro integration. The trajectory highlights a cycle of implementing and debugging the Swift CLI, particularly in generating valid  files and packaging them into a Logic Pro-compatible ZIP structure.

Key challenges involved resolving persistent Swift compilation issues due to evolving API usage (e.g., pointer handling,  vs ), correctly identifying AU plugin identifiers ( for TDR Nova), and ensuring parameters set in the Swift CLI were actually reflected when presets were loaded in Logic Pro. Significant effort was also spent on rectifying the Python backend's ZIP generation logic (moving from  to ) to ensure all generated presets were included. The most critical, and currently unresolved, issue is the Swift CLI's **incomplete state capture** during preset saving, where  returns an insufficient 8 bytes, and vital plugin-specific XML () is missing, preventing parameters from truly changing in Logic Pro.

The Vocal Chain Assistant application is designed to analyze audio, recommend vocal processing chains using nine specific free third-party Audio Unit plugins (1176 Compressor, MAutoPitch, MCompressor, MEqualizer, Graillon 3, TDR Nova, LA-LA, Fresh Air, MConvolutionEZ), and export these as Logic Pro presets. The React frontend displays recommendations, which are then fulfilled by a FastAPI backend. The core problem involved reliably generating XML-based  files for these plugins.

Initially, the goal was direct installation into Logic Pro directories, but this evolved to generating a single  file mirroring Logic Pro's expected folder layout (). This ZIP allows users to manually extract into their  folder. Parameters must correctly apply upon loading. The Swift CLI () was developed to leverage native macOS Audio Unit APIs for instantiation, parameter setting, and state export. The Swift CLI needs to support packaging options like , , , and utilize  for macOS-native ZIP creation. A critical, persistent problem has been ensuring that parameters *actually change* in Logic Pro, not just that presets load.

-   : The main FastAPI application.
    -   **Importance**: Handles API requests, including the  endpoint which orchestrates vocal chain generation and preset packaging.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to consolidate parameter conversion logic and integrate with the new Swift CLI features by calling .  function in the backend was enhanced to handle plugin-specific string booleans (On/Off) for TDR Nova.
-   : Python wrapper for the Swift CLI ().
    -   **Importance**: Manages the invocation of the Swift CLI, including constructing arguments for preset generation and ZIP creation.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified for environment detection, configurable paths,  utility for type mapping, and the core logic for generating presets and managing per-plugin path configurations. The ZIP packaging logic was fixed from  to  to correctly include all presets. Contains logic to map generic parameter names to plugin-specific IDs for TDR Nova and to auto-activate bands.

    -   **Importance**: This is the critical component responsible for natively interacting with macOS Audio Unit APIs, instantiating plugins, setting parameters, and exporting their state as  files.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent multiple revisions to fix compilation errors (e.g.,  vs ,  vs  for  parameters, proper nil handling with ), to add new CLI options (, , , ), and to implement macOS -based ZIP creation with the Logic Pro folder structure. The  function was modified to attempt direct  and, if that fails (as it currently does with TDR Nova), to construct a manual  structure, incorporating the raw  blob from  (though this 8-byte  is currently insufficient).

<pending_tasks>
-   The core pending task is to debug and fix the Swift CLI's  function in  to properly capture the complete Audio Unit state for plugins like TDR Nova. This involves addressing the issue of  returning only 8 bytes and ensuring the  XML and a sufficiently large binary  field are included in the generated  file, consistent with a manually saved Logic Pro preset.
-   Regenerate / update parameter mappings for MeldaProduction plugins (MAutoPitch, MCompressor, MConvolutionEZ, MEqualizer) to use correct AU parameter IDs and normalized 0.0-1.0 ranges, similar to the TDR Nova fix.
-   Once the Swift CLI accurately captures and saves plugin state, integrate this fully into the Python backend and web application.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was debugging the persistent issue where generated presets, while loading in Logic Pro, were not causing actual parameter changes. A critical breakthrough was made by analyzing a user-provided PDF, which highlighted that plugins often store their state as binary data chunks, and for JUCE-based plugins like TDR Nova, a  XML field is crucial.

The Swift CLI () was extensively refactored and debugged through multiple iterations to achieve a successful build on the user's Mac (Swift 6.1.2), correctly identify AU identifiers ( for TDR Nova), and apply parameters using . However, the  function is currently failing to capture the *complete* plugin state:  only returns an 8-byte  field, and the  XML with actual parameter values is entirely missing. This discrepancy was confirmed by comparing a manually saved TDR Nova preset with a generated one. The manual preset contained  XML and a much larger binary data field (approx. 10KB), which our generated presets lack, resulting in inert presets.
