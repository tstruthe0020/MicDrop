# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The free_plugin_chains.py file contains old plugin list (TDR Kotelnikov, TDR De-esser, Softube Saturation Knob, Valhalla Supermassive, etc.) instead of the 9 plugins user provided seed files for (LALA, TDR Nova, MAutoPitch, Fresh Air, Graillon 3, MCompressor, MEqualizer, MConvolutionEZ, 1176 Compressor). Must completely rewrite to use ONLY user's 9 plugins."

        - comment: "✅ CRITICAL SUCCESS: Plugin restriction system is working perfectly! Comprehensive testing across all 6 vibes (Clean, Warm, Punchy, Bright, Vintage, Balanced) confirms that ONLY the user's 9 plugins are being recommended: MEqualizer, MCompressor, 1176 Compressor, TDR Nova, MAutoPitch, Graillon 3, Fresh Air, LA-LA, MConvolutionEZ. NO forbidden plugins (TDR Kotelnikov, TDR De-esser, Softube Saturation Knob, Valhalla Supermassive, etc.) are being recommended. The /api/recommend endpoint is functioning correctly and generating appropriate vocal chains for different genres (Pop, R&B, Hip-Hop) based on vibe selection. All 14 backend tests passed including the critical plugin restriction compliance test."

        - agent: "main"
        - comment: "✅ FULLY COMPLETED AND WORKING! Enhanced parameter extraction system to handle XML (TDR Nova) and binary formats. Fixed critical apply_values function to properly update both XML and binary parameter data. Created intelligent parameter mapping with human-readable names. Generated complete parameter maps for all 9 plugins with meaningful names like Band_1_Frequency, Threshold, Attack, etc. Created example value sets for clean vocal processing. Full vocal chain generation script working perfectly - generates 8 .aupreset files with ACTUAL parameter changes applied. VERIFICATION: TDR Nova XML parameters correctly updated (bandGain_1: -2.5, bandFreq_1: 300), binary plugins like MEqualizer correctly updated (param_0: 0.0, param_1: 80.0), 1176 Compressor correctly updated (param_1: 3.0, param_5: 1.0). All plugins now generate presets with properly applied parameter values instead of just copying seed values."

Comprehensive testing confirms that the vocal chain generation system ONLY recommends the user's 9 plugins across all vibe settings. The /api/recommend endpoint successfully generates professional vocal chains using MEqualizer, MCompressor, 1176 Compressor, TDR Nova, MAutoPitch, Graillon 3, Fresh Air, LA-LA, and MConvolutionEZ.
